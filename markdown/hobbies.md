# My hobbies

- I love to program, it's my passion. That is probably why I am in this field. I have been programming since I was 14 years old, I bought a book called "HTML Dog", and my journey just blasted off from there. From learning Linux, shell scripting, web development, automation with shell scripts, to learning programming languages like Node.js, Python, Go, and Java (Not as familiar with Java anymore). I love to learn new things and learning how certain things work.
- I enjoy working out, I go to the gym about 3 times a week. I also enjoy hiking, it is something I would definitely say yes to if someone were to invite me.
- Singing, although I am not a great or talented singer, I do enjoy singing to express my emotions verbally. It is one way I can express myself. My music genres range from classical to pop, to rap, to rock, to deathcore metal.
- During my down time I also play video games, it is something to help me destress. I play mainly strategic games like Factorio, and Dyson Sphere Program. I am also a really big fan of ARPGs such as Diablo series, Path of Exile, Last Epoch and Grim Dawn. Recently getting into survival crafting games like No Man's Sky, Core Keeper, and Valheim.
- I also enjoy watching animes, my favourite anime is Tokyo Ghoul.
- I have my own home lab where I experiment with different technologies, I have a Raspberry Pi 4 and a Proxmox server. I am currently experimenting with Kubernetes and Docker to see how I can use it to improve my home lab. I really like coolify right now especially as a hosting alternative to Vercel that is free.
